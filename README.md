For learning about raft by implementing it in Python

# Design

Use Python RPC server and client to send messages between the raft servers.

Create a single Python program which implements all three Raft states. This will be run multiple times.

Not yet sure how to handle changes to the configuration - haven't seen how this is done according to the Raft documents.
